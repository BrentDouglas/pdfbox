      See package:<a href="../apidocs/org/apache/pdfbox/pdmodel/common/filespecification/package-summary.html">org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.common.filespecification</a> <br/>

      <p>
      	A PDF can contain references to external files via the file system or a URL to a remote location.
      	It is also possible to embed a binary file into a PDF document.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are two classes that can be used when referencing a file.
      <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/pdfbox/examples/pdmodel/common/filespecification/PDSimpleFileSpecification.html">PDSimpleFileSpecification</a>
      is a simple string reference to a file(e.g. "./movies/BigMovie.avi").  The simple file specification does not allow for any parameters to be
      set.  The <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/pdfbox/examples/pdmodel/common/filespecification/PDComplexFileSpecification.html">PDComplexFileSpecification</a>
      is more feature rich and allows for advanced settings on the file reference.
      </p>

      <p>
      It is also possible to embed a file directly into a PDF.  Instead of setting the file attribute of the PDComplexFileSpecification, the
      EmbeddedFile attribute can be used instead.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="File Attachments">
      <p>
      PDF documents can contain file attachments that are accessed from the Document->File Attachments menu.  PDFBox allows attachments
      to be added to and extracted from PDF documents.  Attachments are part of the named tree that is attached to the document catalog.
