  </properties>

    <section name="Building PDFBox">
      <p>
      	This page will describe how to build PDFBox.  Most users should find the binary releases adequate, but
      	if you are contributing to PDFBox then you will need to know how to properly build the project.
      </p>

      <p>
      	You can obtain the latest source of PDFBox from SVN, see the
      	<a href="../download.html">Apache PDFBox</a>
      	site for information
      	about how to connect to SVN.  The below instructions should also work for a released/nightly distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
      	<ol>
      		<li>Install <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ANT</a>, PDFBox currently uses 1.6.2 but other
      		    versions probably work as well.</li>
      		<li>(Optional)Setup Apache Forrest, Forrest is used for
      		    PDFBox documentation but is not required to compile PDFBox.
      			<ol>
      				<li>Install <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Forrest</a></li>
      				<li>In the build.properties, set the forrest.home property
      				<br /><br />
      				<table>
				  	<tr><td>
				  	forrest.home=c:\\javalib\\apache-forrest-0.6\\src\\core
					</td></tr>
				  </table><br />
      				</li>
      			</ol>
      		</li>
      		<li>(Optional)Place the junit.jar file in the ANT_HOME\lib directory.  This is required
      		    to run the junit tests but not to compile PDFBox.</li>
      		<li>(Optional)Setup IKVM, if you want to build the .NET DLL version of PDFBox.

      			<ol>
      				<li><a href="http://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM</a> binaries</li>
      				<li>In the build.properties, set the ikvm.dir property
      				<br /><br />
      				<table>
				  	<tr><td>
				  	ikvm.dir=C:\\javalib\\ikvm-12-07-2004\\ikvm
					</td></tr>
				  </table><br />
      				</li>
      			</ol>
      		</li>
      		<li>Run 'ant' from the root PDFBox directory.  This will create the .zip package
      		    distribution.  See the build file for other ant targets.</li>

      	</ol>
      	<note>If you want to run PDFBox from an IDE them you will need to add the 'Resources' directory
      	      to the project classpath in your IDE.
      	 </note>

    <section name="Running/Debugging PDFBox in Eclipse">
    	<p>
    		In order to run PDFBox from within Eclipse there are a couple things that need to be setup.  Certain
    		pieces of functionality require access to the Resources folder.  Here is an example of what you need
    		to do to run the ExtractText command line application.
    		<ol>
    			<li>In Eclipse click on "run..." or "debug..."</li>
    			<li>In the tree on the left select "Java Application" and click "New"</li>
    			<li>Name it, select the correct project, and the main class</li>
    			<li>Select the "Arguments" tab and enter the command line arguments to the app</li>
    			<li>Select the "Classpath" tab, the pdfbox project and jars should already be added in the "User Entries"</li>
    			<li>Select the "User Entries" item and click the "Advanced" button</li>
    			<li>The "Add Folder" radio button should be selected, press ok</li>
    			<li>Select the root of the pdfbox project, this will make the "Resources" folder available on the classpath.</li>
    		</ol>
