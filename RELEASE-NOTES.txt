Release Notes -- Apache PDFBox -- Version 1.2.0

Introduction
------------

PDFBox is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents.

This is an incremental feature release based on the earlier 1.1.0 release.
When upgrading to this release, please note that the Ant and Lucene
integration code has been moved to separate pdfbox-ant and pdfbox-lucene
components that are also included in this release. The PDFBox resource
directory has also been moved from /Resources to /org/apache/pdfbox/resources,
so you will need to update your paths if your application adds extra resources
to PDFBox. For more details on these changes and all the other fixes and
improvements included in this release, please refer to the following issues
on the PDFBox issue tracker at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX.
