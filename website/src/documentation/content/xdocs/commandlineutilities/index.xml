      <p>
	      PDFBox comes with a series of command line utilities.  They are available as windows binaries
	      and as standard Java applications.
      </p>
      <p>
	      In order to run them as java applications you need to add the following jars to your classpath
	  </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>%PDFBOX_HOME%\external\log4j-1.2.9.jar</li>
      	<li>%PDFBOX_HOME%\lib\PDFBox-0.X.X.jar</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>
	      PDFBox uses log4j for logging, if you do not set up log4j then you will get a warning like this

      <note>
        log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.pdfbox.util.ResourceLoader).<br/>
